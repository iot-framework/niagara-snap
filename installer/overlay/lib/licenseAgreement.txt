You may transfer and use the Licensed Software on a backup computer system you own or lease if, and only for so long as, the Designated System is (i) inoperative or (ii) unavailable due to regularly scheduled maintenance, upon issuance by Tridium of a backup license key. 
1.2 	No Other Rights Granted. Apart from the license expressly granted herein, no license or other right is granted by Tridium to you under this Agreement, either directly or by implication, estoppel, or otherwise (including, but not limited to, the right to prepare derivative works). You shall have no right or access to the source code of the Licensed Software other than the source code, if any, for certain application program interfaces that are included with the Licensed Software.  If any source code is included with the Licensed Software, it is provided solely as a reference, is provided subject to all of the limitations of Section 2 below, and may not be modified by you in any way.  Furthermore, use of the Commercial Features of any Oracle product included as third party code in the Licensed Materials requires a separate license from Oracle.  "Commercial Features" means those features identified in Table 1-1(Commercial Features in Java SE Product Editions) of the program documentation accessible at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/products/index.html.

You acknowledge that if you conduct any penetration testing or vulnerability assessment on the Licensed Software without first installing the most recent security update issued by Tridium, (i) any vulnerability to a security breach you may discover cannot be attributed to failure on the part of Tridium, and (ii) any statement to a third party indicating that the Licensed Materials have such a vulnerability may be a false statement for which you could be legally liable to Tridium.
